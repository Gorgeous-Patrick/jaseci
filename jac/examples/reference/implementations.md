### Implementations
Implementations in Jac provide a powerful mechanism for separating interface declarations from their concrete implementations. This feature supports modular programming, interface segregation, and flexible code organization patterns common in modern software development.

**Implementation Concept**

The `impl` keyword allows you to define the concrete implementation of previously declared interfaces, including:

- **Function implementations**: Providing bodies for declared function signatures
- **Object implementations**: Adding members and behavior to declared objects  
- **Enumeration implementations**: Defining the values and structure of enums

**Function Implementations**

Functions can be declared with just their signature and implemented separately:

**Declaration:**
```jac
def foo -> str;
```

**Implementation:**
```jac
impl foo -> str {
    return ("Hello");
}
```

This separation enables:
- **Interface definition**: Clearly specify what functions are available
- **Deferred implementation**: Implement functionality when convenient
- **Multiple implementations**: Different implementations for different contexts

**Object Implementations**

Objects can be declared as empty shells and have their structure defined later:

**Declaration:**
```jac
obj vehicle;
```

**Implementation:**
```jac
impl vehicle {
    has name: str = "Car";
}
```

This allows for:
- **Progressive definition**: Build object structure incrementally
- **Modular design**: Separate interface from implementation concerns
- **Flexible organization**: Organize code based on logical groupings

**Enumeration Implementations**

Enumerations can be declared and have their values specified in implementations:

**Declaration:**
```jac
enum Size;
```

**Implementation:**
```jac
impl Size {
    Small=1,
    Medium=2,
    Large=3
}
```

**Benefits of Implementation Separation**

1. **Interface Clarity**: Clean separation between what is available (interface) and how it works (implementation)

2. **Code Organization**: Group related implementations together regardless of where interfaces are declared

3. **Modularity**: Implement different parts of a system in separate modules or files

4. **Testing**: Mock implementations can be provided for testing purposes

5. **Flexibility**: Switch between different implementations based on requirements

**Implementation Requirements**

- **Signature Matching**: Implementation must exactly match the declared signature
- **Type Compatibility**: Return types and parameter types must be consistent
- **Completeness**: All declared interfaces must eventually have implementations

The provided code example demonstrates all three types of implementations: a function returning a string, an object with a name field, and an enumeration with three size values. The entry block shows how these implemented constructs can be used just like directly defined ones.

Implementations provide a robust foundation for building scalable, maintainable Jac applications with clear architectural boundaries.
