\chapter{Introduction}

Welcome!! Wow, I'm so proud of you. You're, actually reading a book!?!? In this day and age?!?! Well, you're in for a treat. This book will guide you through the Jac programming language and help you understand how to use it to build amazing applications in the age of AI.

To get a feel for Jac, here is a tiny example that computes the area of a circle using both a function and an object-oriented approach:

\begin{jacblock}[caption={A tiny Jac program: circle area via function and class}]
import math;

glob RAD = 5;

def calculate_area(radius: float) -> float {
    return math.pi * radius * radius;
}

enum ShapeType {
    CIRCLE = "Circle",
    UNKNOWN = "Unknown"
}

obj Shape {
    has shape_type: ShapeType;
    def area -> float abs;
}

obj Circle(Shape) {
    def init(radius: float) {
        super.init(ShapeType.CIRCLE);
        self.radius = radius;
    }

    override def area -> float {
        return math.pi * self.radius * self.radius;
    }
}

with entry {
    c = Circle(RAD);
}

with entry:__main__ {
    print(f"Area via function: {calculate_area(RAD)}");
    print(f"Area via class: {c.area()}");
}
\end{jacblock}
