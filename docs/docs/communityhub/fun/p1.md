## Project Idea: Enhancing Aider with Jac Object-Spatial Programming

This project proposes enhancing Aider's architecture using Jac's object-spatial programming paradigm and MTLLM (`by <llm>`) features to optimize multi-file editing, token handling, and repository understanding through graph-based representations.

### Core Concepts

#### Aider's Functionality

Aider assists developers by:

1.  **Understanding Code Structure:** Analyzing the existing codebase to build a mental model.
2.  **Responding to Prompts:** Taking user requests (e.g., "add a new feature," "fix this bug," "refactor this code").
3.  **Generating Code Changes:** Producing code snippets or entire file modifications.
4.  **Applying Changes:** Integrating the generated code into the existing codebase.
5.  **Iterative Refinement:** Allowing users to review, accept, or reject changes, and provide further instructions.

#### Understanding Aider's Current Architecture

Aider's success comes from several key architectural decisions:

*   **Tree-sitter Based Repository Map:** Uses tree-sitter to parse source code into ASTs, extracting symbol definitions and references to create a concise map of the codebase.
*   **Graph Ranking Algorithm:** Analyzes dependencies between files as a graph, using ranking algorithms to select the most relevant portions of the repo_map that fit within token budgets (default 1k tokens via `--map-tokens`).
*   **Multiple Edit Formats:** Supports different edit formats (diff, whole, udiff, diff-fenced, editor-*) optimized for different LLM capabilities and use cases.
*   **Architect/Editor Mode:** Separates high-level reasoning (architect) from detailed code editing (editor), allowing optimal model pairing (e.g., o1 + GPT-4o).
*   **Context Management:** Dynamically adjusts repo_map size based on chat state, expanding when no files are in context, contracting when specific files are being edited.
*   **Git Integration:** Automatic commits, diff management, and change tracking through git integration.

#### Jac OSP Value Proposition

Where Jac's Object-Spatial Programming can enhance this proven architecture:

*   **Richer Graph Representation:** While Aider uses file-level dependency graphs for ranking, OSP can represent finer-grained relationships (function calls, variable usage, type dependencies) as first-class spatial relationships.
*   **Advanced Traversal Patterns:** Jac walkers can implement sophisticated traversal algorithms for context gathering that go beyond simple graph ranking.
*   **Multi-File Change Coordination:** OSP's spatial relationships can help ensure consistency across complex refactoring that spans multiple files.
*   **Query-Based Context Selection:** Instead of purely algorithmic ranking, enable semantic queries like "find all functions that handle user authentication" through spatial traversal.
*   **Incremental Graph Updates:** Maintain live graph representation that updates as code changes, enabling more sophisticated change impact analysis.

### Specific Improvements Target Areas

#### 1. Repository Map and Graph Ranking Optimization

Current Aider implementation uses file-level dependency graphs. OSP enhancements:

```jac
# Enhanced graph structure for finer-grained analysis
node CodeSymbol {
    has name: str;
    has symbol_type: str; // function, class, variable, import
    has file_path: str;
    has line_range: tuple[int, int];
    has usage_frequency: int;
    has centrality_score: float;
}

edge CodeRelation {
    has relation_type: str; // calls, inherits, imports, references, modifies
    has strength: float; // relationship strength based on frequency/importance
    has context: str; // additional context about the relationship
}

walker EnhancedRepoMapper {
    has token_budget: int;
    has focus_entities: list[str] = [];

    can build_enhanced_map() -> dict[str, any] {
        # Use spatial traversal to build richer maps than current tree-sitter approach
        relevant_symbols = self.find_relevant_symbols();
        return self.generate_contextual_map(relevant_symbols);
    }

    can optimize_ranking_algorithm() -> list[CodeSymbol] {
        # Implement enhanced PageRank considering code-specific relationships
        # Weight by actual usage patterns, not just structural dependencies
        scores = {};
        visit [-->] {
            score = self.calculate_symbol_importance(here);
            scores[here.name] = score;
        }
        return sorted(scores.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True);
    }
}
```

#### 2. Token Handling Optimization

Current Aider uses fixed token budgets. OSP improvements:

```jac
walker SmartTokenManager {
    has base_budget: int = 1000;
    has context_expansion_factor: float = 1.5;
    has current_context: dict[str, any] = {};

    can optimize_token_allocation(user_request: str, repo_context: dict) -> dict[str, str] by <llm>;

    can dynamic_context_expansion() -> dict[str, str] {
        # Expand context based on spatial relationships and user intent
        if len(self.current_context) == 0 {
            # No files in context - expand repo map significantly
            budget = self.base_budget * self.context_expansion_factor;
        } else {
            # Files in context - focus on related entities
            budget = self.base_budget;
        }

        return self.select_optimal_context(budget);
    }

    can adaptive_summarization(large_context: dict[str, str]) -> dict[str, str] by <llm> {
        # Use LLM to intelligently summarize large context while preserving key information
    }
}
```

#### 3. Multi-File Editing Coordination

Address Aider's current limitations in complex multi-file changes:

```jac
walker MultiFileCoordinator {
    has change_plan: list[CodeEdit] = [];
    has affected_files: set[str] = set();
    has dependency_chain: list[str] = [];

    can analyze_change_impact(proposed_edits: list[CodeEdit]) -> ChangeImpact {
        # Use spatial traversal to find all affected code
        impact = ChangeImpact();

        for edit in proposed_edits {
            # Find all dependent code
            target_node = self.find_node_by_path(edit.file_path);
            visit target_node [-->:CodeRelation] {
                if here not in self.affected_files {
                    impact.affected_files.append(here.file_path);
                    self.affected_files.add(here.file_path);
                }
            }
        }

        return impact;
    }

    can validate_cross_file_consistency(edits: list[CodeEdit]) -> list[str] by <llm> {
        # Use LLM to validate that changes maintain API contracts across files
    }

    can generate_propagated_changes(base_edits: list[CodeEdit]) -> list[CodeEdit] by <llm> {
        # Generate additional required changes to maintain consistency
    }
}
```

#### 4. Architecture and Editor LLM Optimization

Enhance Aider's architect/editor pipeline with OSP context:

```jac
walker OSPArchitect {
    can enhanced_architectural_analysis(
        user_request: str,
        spatial_context: dict[str, any],
        change_history: list[dict]
    ) -> ArchitecturalPlan by <llm> {
        # Provide richer context to architect LLM including:
        # - Spatial relationships between code entities
        # - Historical change patterns
        # - Impact analysis of proposed changes
    }
}

walker OSPEditor {
    can spatial_aware_editing(
        architectural_plan: ArchitecturalPlan,
        detailed_context: dict[str, str],
        spatial_constraints: list[str]
    ) -> list[CodeEdit] by <llm> {
        # Generate edits with awareness of spatial relationships
        # Ensure edits respect dependency constraints and API contracts
    }
}
```

### Proposed OSP Mode Implementation

Building upon Aider's proven architecture, we propose specific enhancements using Jac's object-spatial programming:

1.  **Enhanced Repository Graph with OSP:**
    *   Extend Aider's existing tree-sitter based repo_map with Jac's spatial graph capabilities.
    *   Create a dynamic, queryable codebase graph where nodes represent code entities (files, classes, functions, variables) and edges represent relationships (calls, imports, dependencies, inheritance).
    *   Use Jac's native graph traversal to optimize the current graph ranking algorithm that selects relevant portions of the repository map.

2.  **Intelligent Context Retrieval with Spatial Walkers:**
    *   Implement specialized walkers that can traverse the codebase graph to gather contextually relevant information.
    *   `ContextGatheringWalker` - navigates from a starting point to collect related code entities based on semantic distance and dependency relationships.
    *   `ImpactAnalysisWalker` - determines which files/functions would be affected by proposed changes.
    *   `DependencyWalker` - maps function call chains and import dependencies for better context understanding.

3.  **MTLLM-Optimized Architect and Editor Pipeline:**
    *   Enhance Aider's existing architect/editor mode with OSP-optimized prompting.
    *   `ArchitectLLM` - analyzes user requests and proposes high-level changes using the spatial graph context.
    *   `EditorLLM` - translates architectural decisions into specific code edits, optimized for Aider's existing edit formats (diff, whole, udiff).
    *   Use Jac's `by <llm>` syntax to create specialized abilities for different aspects of code understanding and generation.

4.  **Enhanced Token Budget Management:**
    *   Implement dynamic token allocation using spatial graph analysis.
    *   `TokenBudgetOptimizer` - walker that prioritizes which parts of the repo_map to include based on relevance scores derived from graph centrality and user context.
    *   Smart context windowing that expands/contracts based on the complexity of the requested changes.

5.  **Multi-File Change Coordination:**
    *   `ChangeCoordinator` - walker that ensures consistency across multi-file edits.
    *   Implements change propagation logic to maintain code integrity across file boundaries.
    *   Validates that changes in one file don't break contracts expected by dependent files.

6.  **OSP-Enhanced Mode:**
    *   Introduce a new `/spatial` mode that leverages full OSP capabilities.
    *   This mode builds and maintains a live graph of the codebase, updating it as changes are made.
    *   Provides advanced querying capabilities like "find all functions that depend on this API" or "show me the call chain for this error path".

### Key OSP Optimizations for Aider's Core Components

#### 1. Repository Map Enhancement
### Proposed OSP Mode Implementation

Building upon Aider's existing chat modes (code, architect, ask, help), introduce a new `/spatial` mode:

```jac
walker SpatialModeHandler {
    has repo_graph: 'CodeRepository';
    has current_context: dict[str, any] = {};
    has query_history: list[str] = [];

    can handle_spatial_command(command: str, args: list[str]) -> str {
        match command {
            case "find": return self.spatial_find(args);
            case "trace": return self.trace_dependencies(args);
            case "impact": return self.analyze_impact(args);
            case "related": return self.find_related_code(args);
            case "cluster": return self.find_code_clusters(args);
        }
    }

    can spatial_find(query_terms: list[str]) -> str {
        # Find code entities based on spatial queries
        # Example: /spatial find "authentication AND user"
        results = [];
        visit [-->] where self.matches_query(here, query_terms) {
            results.append(here);
        }
        return self.format_search_results(results);
    }

    can trace_dependencies(target: list[str]) -> str {
        # Trace dependency chains
        # Example: /spatial trace login_function
        chains = [];
        start_node = self.find_entity(target[0]);
        visit start_node [-->:CodeRelation] {
            chains.append(self.build_dependency_chain(here));
        }
        return self.format_dependency_traces(chains);
    }

    can analyze_impact(change_description: list[str]) -> str by <llm> {
        # Analyze potential impact of described changes
        # Example: /spatial impact "change User class to use new auth system"
    }
}
```

#### Integration with Existing Aider Commands

Extend existing commands with spatial awareness:

```bash
# Enhanced /add command with spatial context
/add --spatial file.py  # Automatically add related files based on dependencies

# Enhanced repository understanding
/spatial find "error handling"  # Find all error handling code
/spatial trace payment_flow     # Trace payment processing dependencies
/spatial impact "database schema change"  # Analyze impact of schema changes

# Context expansion based on spatial relationships
/expand --spatial  # Add files related to current context via graph traversal
```

### Expected Benefits and Improvements

#### 1. Better Multi-File Editing
- **Current Issue:** Aider sometimes misses dependent files that need updates when making complex changes
- **OSP Solution:** Spatial traversal ensures all related code is identified and considered
- **Example:** When refactoring an API, automatically identify all client code that needs updates

#### 2. Optimized Token Usage
- **Current Issue:** Fixed token budgets may include irrelevant code or miss important context
- **OSP Solution:** Dynamic context selection based on spatial relevance and user intent
- **Example:** For authentication changes, prioritize auth-related code over unrelated utilities

#### 3. Enhanced Code Understanding
- **Current Issue:** Limited to file-level dependencies and tree-sitter symbol extraction
- **OSP Solution:** Function-level dependencies, usage patterns, and semantic relationships
- **Example:** Understanding that error handling functions are related even across different modules

#### 4. Improved Change Impact Analysis
- **Current Issue:** Manual identification of files that might be affected by changes
- **OSP Solution:** Automated impact analysis using graph traversal
- **Example:** Changing a database model automatically identifies all services, controllers, and tests that use it

### Performance Benchmarks and Metrics

To validate the OSP enhancements, we would measure:

1. **Multi-File Change Success Rate:** Percentage of complex changes that don't require manual fixes
2. **Context Relevance Score:** How often included context is actually used in generated changes
3. **Token Efficiency:** Amount of relevant context per token in the budget
4. **Change Completeness:** Percentage of dependent changes automatically identified
5. **User Satisfaction:** Reduced number of iterations needed to complete complex tasks

### Practical Implementation Strategy

#### Phase 1: Proof of Concept (Weeks 1-4)
```jac
# Basic spatial graph representation
node CodeFile {
    has path: str;
    has content: str;
    has symbols: list[str];

}

walker BasicSpatialMapper {
    can build_file_graph(repo_path: str) -> 'SpatialGraph';
    can find_related_files(target_file: str) -> list[str];
}
```
