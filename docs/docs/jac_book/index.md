# Jac Programming Language Book

Welcome to the comprehensive guide to the Jac programming language. This book will take you from a complete beginner to an advanced Jac developer, covering everything from basic syntax to building scalable, cloud-native applications.

!!! info "About This Book"
    Jac is a revolutionary programming language that introduces **Object-Spatial Programming (OSP)**, a paradigm that inverts the traditional relationship between data and computation. Instead of moving data to computation, Jac moves computation to data through spatially-aware constructs like nodes, edges, and walkers.

    This book is structured to provide both theoretical understanding and practical experience, with extensive code examples and real-world applications throughout.
