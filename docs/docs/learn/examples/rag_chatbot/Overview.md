# RAG Chatbot Overview

This project demonstrates a modern Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot built using the Jac programming language, MTLLM, Jac Cloud, and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. It combines document ingestion, semantic search, and large language models (LLMs) to deliver a conversational AI experience that can answer questions based on your own documents.

## Key Features

- **Document Upload & Ingestion**: Upload PDF files, which are automatically processed and indexed for semantic search.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: Combines LLMs with document retrieval for accurate, context-aware answers.
- **Web Search Integration**: Optionally augments responses with real-time web search results.
- **MCP Server Architecture**: Uses Model Context Protocol for modular tool management and better scalability.
- **Streamlit Frontend**: User-friendly chat interface for interacting with the bot and uploading documents.
- **API Server**: RESTful endpoints for chat, document upload, and more, powered by Jac Cloud.
- **Session Management**: Maintains chat history and user sessions.

## Technologies Used
- Jac & Jac Cloud & Jac MTLLM
- Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- LangChain, ChromaDB, PyPDF, Streamlit
- OpenAI or local LLMs (Ollama)

## Architecture

- **client.jac**: Implements the Streamlit-based frontend for chat and document upload.
- **server.jac**: Hosts the API, manages sessions, and coordinates with MCP tools using ReAct pattern.
- **mcp_server.jac**: MCP server that exposes document search and web search tools.
- **mcp_client.jac**: Client interface for communicating with MCP servers.
- **tools.jac**: Contains the RAG engine and web search implementations used by the MCP server.

```

To run the MCP server (in one terminal)
```bash
jac run mcp_server.jac
```

To run the main server (in another terminal)
