## What is MTP?

Meaning-Typed Programming (MTP) is a groundbreaking paradigm that automates LLM integration through intuitive language-level constructs. Instead of manually crafting prompts and handling outputs, MTP extracts semantic meaning from your existing code to automatically generate prompts and convert responses. This enables you to focus on building agentic software applications that can reason, plan, and act autonomously, by leveraging LLMs as intelligent agents within your workflows. There is an extensive research journey which you can dive into, available on arxiv.org.

The MTP concept is realized in Jac-lang as the **MTLLM** plugin which can be installed as a PyPi package.
