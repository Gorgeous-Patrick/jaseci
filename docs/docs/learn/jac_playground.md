# Jac Playground Guide

Welcome to the Jac Playground! This interactive development environment lets you write, run, and debug Jac programs directly in your browser.

## Getting Started

The Jac Playground is designed to help you learn and experiment with the Jac programming language. When you first open the playground, you'll see a simple "Hello World" program:

```jac
with entry {
    print("Welcome to Jac!");
}
```

## Interface Overview

### Main Editor
The left side of the screen contains the code editor where you can write your Jac programs. The editor features:

- Syntax highlighting for Jac language
- Line numbers for easy reference
- Auto-indentation and bracket matching

### Control Panel
At the top of the editor, you'll find:

- **Run Button** ‚ñ∂Ô∏è - Execute your Jac program
- **Reset Button** üîÑ - Clear the editor and start fresh
- **Debug Mode Toggle** üêõ - Enable debugging features for step-by-step execution

### Output Panel
The bottom section displays the output of your program, including:

- Print statements and results
- Error messages and debugging information
- Program execution feedback

### Example Library
The right sidebar contains a collection of sample programs organized by category:

#### Basic Examples
- **For Loop** - Learn iteration with for loops
- **While Loop** - Understand conditional looping
- **Archetypes** - Explore Jac's type system
- **Code Block Statements** - Work with code organization
- **Assignments** - Variable declaration and manipulation
- **Conditional Statements** - If/else logic and branching

#### Object Spatial Programming
- **Reference** - Understanding object references and relationships

## How to Use

1. **Start with Examples**: Click on any example from the right sidebar to load it into the editor
2. **Modify and Experiment**: Edit the code to see how changes affect the output
3. **Run Your Code**: Press the "Run" button to execute your program
4. **Debug When Needed**: Enable Debug Mode for detailed execution analysis
5. **Reset When Stuck**: Use the Reset button to start with a clean slate

## Debug Mode
When Debug Mode is enabled, you get additional features:

- Step-by-step program execution
- Variable state inspection
- Detailed error reporting
- Execution flow visualization

## Tips for New Users

- Start with the "Basic" examples to understand Jac syntax
- Use the print statement to output values and debug your code
- Experiment with modifying the example programs
- Don't be afraid to break things - that's how you learn!
- Use Debug Mode when your program doesn't behave as expected

## Example Categories Explained

### Basic Programming Concepts
These examples cover fundamental programming constructs that are essential for any Jac programmer.

### Object Spatial Programming
Jac's unique approach to spatial programming and object relationships. These advanced examples show how Jac handles complex data structures and spatial reasoning.
