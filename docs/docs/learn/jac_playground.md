#### Object Spatial Programming
- **Reference** - Understanding object references and relationships

## How to Use

1. **Start with Examples**: Click on any example from the right sidebar to load it into the editor
2. **Modify and Experiment**: Edit the code to see how changes affect the output
3. **Run Your Code**: Press the "Run" button to execute your program
4. **Debug When Needed**: Enable Debug Mode for detailed execution analysis
5. **Reset When Stuck**: Use the Reset button to start with a clean slate

## Debug Mode
Debug Mode transforms the Jac Playground into a powerful development environment with advanced debugging capabilities. When enabled, the interface splits into two main sections: the code editor on the left and the **Jaclang Graph Visualizer** on the right.

### Jaclang Graph Visualizer

### Debug Controls

When Debug Mode is active, you'll notice additional controls in the Run Mode toolbar:

- **Play Button** ‚ñ∂Ô∏è - Start or continue execution
- **Step Forward** ‚è≠Ô∏è - Execute the next line of code
- **Step Down** ‚¨áÔ∏è - Move deeper into function calls
- **Step Up** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è - Move up from current execution context
- **Refresh** üîÑ - Reset the debug session
- **Stop** ‚èπÔ∏è - Terminate the current debug session

The Graph Visualizer is one of Jac's most powerful debugging features, providing a real-time visual representation of your program's execution flow. This unique tool shows:

#### Node and Edge Visualization
- **Nodes**: Represent different stages, objects, or states in your Jac program
- **Edges**: Show the connections and relationships between nodes
- **Dynamic Updates**: As you step through code execution, new nodes and edges appear dynamically

#### Real-time Code Tracking
- The currently executing line is highlighted in yellow in the code editor
- The visualizer synchronizes with code execution, showing which nodes are active
- Variable states and object properties are displayed within their respective nodes

### Advanced Debug Features

When Debug Mode is enabled, you get access to:

- **Step-by-step program execution** with full control over execution flow
- **Variable state inspection** through the node visualizer
- **Detailed error reporting** with exact line and context information
- **Execution flow visualization** showing how your Jac program moves through different states
- **Spatial relationship mapping** unique to Jac's object-spatial programming model

### Using Debug Mode Effectively

1. **Set breakpoints** by clicking on line numbers in the editor
2. **Start debugging** by clicking the Debug button instead of Run
3. **Navigate execution** using the arrow keys or debug controls
4. **Observe the graph** to understand how your nodes and edges are connected
5. **Step through slowly** to see how data flows through your spatial program structure

The Graph Visualizer makes Jac's spatial programming concepts tangible, allowing you to see exactly how your objects, walkers, and edges interact during program execution.


## Tips for New Users

- Start with the "Basic" examples to understand Jac syntax
- Use the print statement to output values and debug your code
- Experiment with modifying the example programs
- Don't be afraid to break things - that's how you learn!
- Use Debug Mode when your program doesn't behave as expected

## Example Categories Explained

### Basic Programming Concepts
These examples cover fundamental programming constructs that are essential for any Jac programmer.

### Object Spatial Programming
Jac's unique approach to spatial programming and object relationships. These advanced examples show how Jac handles complex data structures and spatial reasoning.
